## Preface
The World Wide Web, while it was once thought to be somewhat decentralized, has been transformed over the years into an overly centralized cesspool of authoritarians that are ultimately controlled by governments from around the world, as well as a handful of globally recognized tech companies. That was not how the visionaries of the web intended for it to be, nor would any of them agree with how the web is being ran today.

Beyond the evidence that was revealed by Booz Allen Hamilton contractor Edward Snowden, understanding the fact that the CIA, NSA and various private sector companies, including Google, Facebook and others are highly involved in manipulating mass thought, is crucial, in understanding why the web has to be reimagined [ACKE14]. The clear Chinese-based control over these companies, along with many elected officials within our government has become obvious to many Americans, which should put into plain English why all of the mass censorship and massive election interference is taking place.

It is us, the denizens of the World Wide Web, that have become extremely reliant on how quickly we can communicate with friends and access information via the WWW's many facilities. Although, it is during the process of these various communications and periods of research, that our information, our actions and even our reactions, are collected and then stored within the databases of not only the providers of these facilities but the "virtual, centralized grand database" once envisioned by President Reagan's former national security advisor John Poindexter [ROSE02]. It was Poindexter who was the brainchild of the "Total Information Awareness" program, which became the NSA's Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA), was later renamed "Terrorism Information Awareness" [IWAR] and eventually reincarnated as an alliance between the government and Silicon Valley for-profit companies. Enter Booz Allen Hamilton and other for-profit companies like Palantir, ran by so called "libertarians" like Peter Theil, who are paid by the CIA and the NSA to spy on and gather data  about law-abiding American citizens in the name of "terrorism" [GREE13].

History clearly shows us, even through the admissions of companies like Facebook and academics at Cornell University that they're clearly running psychological experiments on their users [ROBI14], [KRAM14], [GOEL14], [KRISH14]. While they do what all CIA and NSA contractors do and attempt to cover-up their tyrannical behavior with their typical talking points of "civil liberties" and "improvements to their service," it is clear to most that they're actively doing more than simply attempting to improve their services - and the dog regarding their care for our "civil liberties" will never hunt with any true American patriot.

Companies like Facebook, who have clear relationships with the Chinese Government, are far more interested in controlling what we see and quite frankly, what we believe and it's these constant internal studies that allow them to do just that. For years, these private sector companies have been developing internal algorithms, that are used each and every day to study your habits, your mannerisms and other psychological traits in the name of helping improve their various advertising services. What truly opened the eyes of Silicon Valley brainchilds like Mark Zuckerberg though, had little to do with predicting what you would buy - these authoritarians were blown away when their own studies revealed that voting behavior could be influenced by "undetectable social networking maneuvering" [LANI14].

This research I just mentioned happened in 2014 and don't worry, the source I just cited was the ***New York Times*** - just in case they say there is not "widespread evidence of voter manipulation." That's why I felt it was important to cite a New York Times article, regarding a study that Facebook conducted themselves! Facebook and Google's interest in our elections has grown extensively since 2014, where they collectively contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to local governments and various companies, in an attempt to support candidates that had unusual relationships with the Chinese government, like Joe Biden, whose son is the subject of an active FBI investigation for his dealings with Chinese companies as of December 10th, 2020.

What they used to refer as "undetectable maneuvering" is no longer truly undetectable, due to the fact that social networks are not only quietly choosing what you see in your news feed, but are now openly censoring those whose posts rail against the political propaganda machine most Silicon Valley-based social networks have become. This also takes place within search engines like Google, where conservative news stories and websites are rarely shown to those they know are registered democrats (look no further than the blacklisted Hunter Biden story). Their efforts to interfere in the 2020 election were extraordinary and quite obvious to anyone who is concerned with freedom in America.

All of this is made possible by a clear invasion of our privacy that we have allowed to go on for as long as most of us have been alive. This disregard for our own privacy has allowed companies in the private sector to gather data from every corner of our personalities, our lives and our interactions, which they've sold back to the government, in a clear violation of our Fourth Amendment rights. They've used this data to build a clear profile of all of us. They know every African American democrat from Dallas, Texas that ate McDonalds last week, while watching Netflix and they'll make sure that each and every one of them are fed anti-American leftist propaganda until each and every one of them join on with the "American woke."

It was this sort of invasion of privacy that the English administrators over the American colonies took part in, which in turn, according to John Adams, spirited the American Revolution, as much as any other factor. A young John Adams in 1761 once documented a speech of James Otis saying "every man of a crowded audience appeared to me to go away, as I did, ready to take up arms against writs of assistance." Otis was delivering a speech where he openly denounced the "writs of assistance," a clear and open demand for privacy, which became a clear motivator in the establishment of our republic. I believe the invasion of privacy we face today, far exceeds what any of our founders could have imagined. Alice Walker once said, "the most common way people give up their power, is by thinking they don't have any," but they have also clearly given up their rights to tech companies across our land, in exchange for convenience and style. Who could have imagined that?

I have said, for quite some time, that we're overdue for another revolution, but this time, a portion of that revolution will certainly be digital. As Chief John Roberts fairly pointed out in Riley vs. California, the Fourth Amendment doesn't simply cover our physical homes, but our digital ones as well. Likewise, true American patriots don't face just a violent physical revolution in order to secure their freedoms, but a digital one as well as and they'll have to have a place in the digital realm, where their voices can be heard, without any possible interference from the left. I say that because building alternatives on the centralized web to Facebook and Google, is not a long-term solution, nor is it a viable one. Their control over us on the web, goes much further than what we see or what we read. They now control our companies, our domain names, what we publish, what we sell and yes, our ability to accept online payments.

Andrew Torba, the founder of Gab, a Facebook alternative for conservatives, has already been banned from most online payment platforms, has had his domain name seized, his servers taken offline and even his family members have been blacklisted by VISA. While that sounds like a conspiracy theory, it's an unimaginable reality that is taking place with companies like Gab today. Organizations like ICANN and ARIN, who control IP address delegation amongst Internet Service Providers and who became domain registrars, are quickly becoming activists for the left's causes and enacting policies that will soon force domain registrars like GoDaddy and web hosting providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), to move on from WWW-based facilities that allow for the distribution of information that goes against the left's propaganda, which is exactly what Gab is used for and it's why Gab was used as a test-case in their effort to shun conservative facilities form the web itself.

Beyond just the web and the threat of ICANN, ARIN and quite frankly Biden's FCC silencing conservatives, is the additional threat of Google and Apple doing the same to mobile applications like Ales Jone's InfoWars, which was abruptly removed from both app stores once it surpassed CNN as the most downloaded news application, within hours of its launch. To put all of this into perspective, companies in Silicon Valley are selling user data to communist governments, running psychological experiments on their users, silencing those who expose their spread of propaganda, interfering in our American elections and are now forming a powerful resistance to alternative facilities that emerge as a result of their total disregard for American civil liberties.

This is why I have embarked on a journey for the past several years, to reimagine the web and build a medium where the people themselves are in control; instead of governments and/or the private sector. A quick look at how long this GitHub profile has been around as well as the amount of research that has gone or here, should reveal that to any open-minded layman. The point of this paper is to make the case for a decentralized alternative to the web that we've been developing for the past four years, known as the "dWeb." It will also explain how the dWeb works and will lay down the clear scientific and mathematical proof, that ensures that the dWeb itself, nor anything on it, can be altered or removed by a single entity, other than the author. At the very same time, this paper will also explain, in-depth, how an elected governance, a distributed election system and a decentralized reporting system are used to ensure that the people of the dWeb, as well as the elected governance, have the delegated authority to remove illegal activity, as well as illegal content, without any centralized systems that could otherwise be used to corrupt and take control of the dWeb by bad actors in the future, just as they have with the traditional web.

While the dWeb facilitates protections from the tyrannical and authoritarian actions of government, as well as the private sector, it also presents technological advances that allow for the global distribution of websites, web applications and various forms of data, without the need for costly infrastructure or the threat of hackers. Those advances, as well as others, are covered in this paper as well.

The need for a decentralized web, during a time where the web has become over-centralized, has become obvious to the many who avidly use the web and have witnessed the constant violation of the human, civil and constitutional rights of the web's users. The influx of countries and their governments whom use the web, as well as the Internet at large, to spy on their citizens has gotten out of control. The lack of privacy is truly alarming and so are the security issues, where even central banks are still unable to protect worthless fiat, after over 20 years of attempting to secure their networks. Now social networks and search engines want to get involved in politics, control what we find or view on their networks and will delete our entire digital existence over a policy violation. Big tech and tyrannical governments like our own know that software developers are building ways to avoid their tactics and are using policies, as well as regulations, to scare of innovators in an attempt to maintain power and keep their usual control mechanisms in place.

Developers, innovators and disseminators of information need a better protocol. They need a completely decentralized web where their hard work can never be destroyed or shutdown by fearful organizations or governments. They simply need a better web where they can experience true privacy, freedom, security and transparency digitally, for the first first time since the inception of the web itself. Isn't that what the web was created for? It's what the dWeb was created for, only this time, we didn't forget to hardcode those rules into its immutable and irreversible existence.

Welcome to the dWeb.

**Note:**
As an added plus, the dWeb is alive as you're reading this and can never be taken offline, as long as people like you are using it. You can start browsing the dWeb by downloading dBrowser [here](https://dbrowser.com) and can begin following our efforts to launch truly decentralized facilities like [dSocial](https://github.com/peepsx/dsocial-whitepaper) and [dSearch](https://peepsx.com/dsearch).


## Abstract
The dWeb is a decentralized web that is formed by a foundation of off-chain, peer-to-peer networking, data communication and data integrity protocols, which enable the exchange and cryptographic validation of data amongst peers. Many dWeb services like dDNS and its reporting system are layered on top of the ARISEN blockchain protocol suite in order to utilize ARISEN's universal authentication layer, public key authority, distributed virtual machine, decentralized network consensus, decentralized payment processing, as well as its on-chain data persistence layer.

This marriage between the dWeb and ARISEN at dWeb's low level service layers, gives way to a powerful ecosystem that can be used to develop secure, serverless and globally scalable applications that are decentralized from end-to-end. The dWeb improves upon the limitations and weaknesses of the World Wide Web, while ensuring that tyrannical governments and private sector companies are unable to regulate or control any aspect of the dWeb itself, without the approval of the dWeb's users. The dWeb is a futuristic web where infrastructure costs are nil, hackers are rendered useless, and the users themselves are placed in control of their data, along with the delegated authority to elect a governance that protects the dWeb at-large from fraud, illegal activity and illegal content, per the dWeb's ratified [Constitution](https://github.com/distributedweb/constitution).

This whitepaper explains the dWeb in-depth, from its foundational protocols and ARISEN's protocol suite, to dWeb-based services like dDNS and its decentralized reporting system.

## Foundational Protocols
The dWeb's foundation of off-chain, peer-to-peer networking, data communications and data integrity protocols, enable peers to announce data, remote peers to discover and swarm data, exchange data and validate the integrity of the data that is ultimately fetched via a dataset's swarm of peers. The following sub-sections will explain each of these foundational protocols and how their reference implementations function.

### DWDHT
DWDHT, an acronym for "dWeb DHT," is a protocol that forms a distributed hash table of dataset identifiers (dWeb network addresses) and the peers that are announcing them. Each database identifier and its announcing peers form what is referred to as a "swarm," which can be queried from connected peers or joined (announced) by a specified amount of peers. dWeb's DHT is literally how a particular dataset is discovered and downloaded from the peers that are openly seeding it (announcing it). Each peer who is announcing a dataset on a long-term basis, by design, becomes a DHT node and is responsible for storing a specific portion of dWeb's DHT. Put another way, each DHT node stores a specific portion of dWeb's DHT. Put another way, each DHT node stores a specific portion of the dWeb's dataset identifiers, along with the peers who currently posses the data related to each of those data identifiers.

While each DHT node stores various swarms, it also stores information regarding other DHT nodes, identified by `node identifiers`, which can be mathematically determined to possess information regarding a specific swarm. dWeb's DHT is based on the `Kademilia Distributed Hash Table` popularized by BitTorrent and others. Nodes and data in dWeb's DHT are assigned 160-bit integers as IDs, while swarms are stored in the form of key-value pairs, where the key is a 32 byte value generated by a one-way hash function, such as SHA-1 (normally a dWeb network address), where the value is an object containing public and LAN-based peers that are announcing the key (the dataset identifier).

#### Node & Data Distribution
The DHT defines the distance between 2 DHT nodes `i` and `j` by the bitwise exclusive OR operations `(XOR)`, i.e., `d(i,j) = i (XOR) j`. This distance means for any given key `i` and a distance `L > 0`, there can only be a single key `j` that satisfies `d(i,j) = L` [ZHAN13].

All key-value pairs are stored on `k` nodes whose UIDs are closest to the actual key. `K` is an important parameter that helps determine data redundancy and how stable the DHT is at any time. Each node `i` always maintains multiple `k`-buckets. Each `k`-bucket stores a list of other DHT nodes, which are organized in an order that reflects the most recently active nodes. The node that is most recently active is stored at the tail, while the least active node is stored at the head.

The node whose distance from node `i` is in the range of [pow(2,m), pow(2,m+1)] is stored in the `m`th `k`-bucket (node that 0 < `m` < 160). The nodes in the `k`-buckets are regarded as the neighbors of the node `i`. A dWeb DHT node dynamically updates its neighbors upon receiving any messages from them. This process can be better explained more specifically, when node `i` receives a message from another DHT node `j`, which is located in the `m`th `k`-bucket, where the `k`-bucket of node `i`, will be updated in the following way:

-If `j` already exists in the `k`-bucket, `i` moves `j` to the tail of the list, as node `j` is the most recently seen.
-If `j` is not in the `k`-bucket and the bucket has fewer than `k` nodes, node `i` inserts `j` at the tail of the list.
-If the bucket is full, `i` PINGs the node at the head of that particular `k`-bucket.
-If the head node responds, node `i` makes it to the tail and ignores node `j`.
-Otherwise, `i` removes the head node and inserts `j` at the tail.

##### DHT Primitives
-`PING` - Probes a DHT node to check whether it's online or not.
-`STORE` - Used to store a key-value pair.
-`FIND_NODE` - Finds a set of nodes that are closest to a given node.
-`FIND_VALUE` - Operates like `FIND_NODE` but returns a stored value.

These RPC-like primitives work in a recursive way, which improves the efficiency of dWeb's DHT. A `lookup` procedure is initiated by the `FIND_NODE` and `FIND_VALUE` primitives, where the lookup initiator chooses `B` nodes from its closest `k`-buckets and send many parallel `FIND_NODE` requests to these `B` nodes. If the node being searched for in a given iteration is not found, the lookup initiator resends the `FIND_NODE` to the nodes that were found during the previous recursive operation and repeats this iterative functionality.

A KV pair may be stored on multiple DHT nodes. Thanks to the recursive procedure explained above, the key-value pair spreads across the DHT network every hour. This process insures that multiple replicas of data exist across the network. Every key-value is deleted 24 hours after it is initially pushed into the network.

##### Joining and Leaving
When node `i` joins dWeb's DHT, it is assumed that it is aware of or knows about node `j`. The joining process consists of multiple steps as follows:
-1. Node `i` inserts `j` into its `k`-buckets
-2. Node `i` starts a node lookup procedure for its own ID, where `i` is made aware of other newer nodes.
-3. Node `i` updates the `k`-buckets

During this process, node `i` strengthens its `k`-buckets and inserts itself into other nodes' `k`-buckets. When other nodes leave or fail, they DO NOT notify any other node. There is no need for a special procedure to cope with node departures, as these mechanisms insure that leaving nodes will be removed from the `k`-buckets.

#### Swarm Announcement
Announcing a swarm means that you're either: announcing a dWeb network address that doesn't exist on dWeb's DHT and therefore become the first peer related to the address; or announcing a dWeb network address that does exist on dWeb's DHT and are added to a list of peers who are announcing the address.

A swarm entry in dWeb's DHT, takes on the following format:

```
Key: 8f0ab2... (32 byte hexadecimal address)
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
Value:
{
  node: { host, port },
  peers: [{ host, port }, { host, port }]
  localPeers: [{ host, port }, { host, port }]
}
```

If a peer is announcing a dWeb network address that matches a key in the DHT, the entry is mutated to include the peer's announced IP address and port. When announcing a dWeb network address, a peer must set their public port and public IP address during the announcement and can choose to set a lan-based address and port as well, so that those on the same public IP who are performing a DHT lookup, can retrieve local announcers for a particular dWeb address. It's important to note that when announcing a dWeb network address on dWeb's DHT, the announcer becomes a DHT node on the network by design.

#### Swarm Lookups
A swarm can be looked up by its dWeb network address, which is a 32 byte buffer (normally a hash of something). When performing a lookup, the querying peer is temporarily an announcing peer, but is removed as an announcing peer (unannounces), once the lookup is finalized.

A lookup for a particular dWeb key, returns the following data:
```
{
  // The dWeb DHT node that is returning this data
  node: { host, port }
  // List of Peers
  peers: [{ host, port }, ...]
  // List of LAN Peers
  localPeers: [{ host, port }, ...]
}
```

#### DHT Bootstrap Nodes
dWeb's network utilized various `bootstrap` nodes to launch the initial dWeb network. These 3 bootstrap nodes are as follows:

-`dht1.dwebx.net`
-`dht2.dwebx.net`
-`dht3.dwebx.net`

These nodes going down would not affect the dWeb or a user's ability to announce or lookup dWeb network addresses, due to the way other DHT nodes on the network share data and information regarding each other. dWeb developers have the option of launching their own bootstrap nodes so that their apps have a point of entry into the dWeb's network of DHT nodes. Those nodes would initially use a set of already existing nodes to gain access to the DHT and would no longer need access to the nodes used for bootstrapping. Any node on the DHT can be used to bootstrap a new node.

#### DWDHT Reference Implementation
The DWDHT reference implementation was written in JavaScript and was used to launch the initial dWeb DHT. You can find it [here](https://github.com/distributedweb/dht).

You can use this reference implementation to allow dWeb-based applications (desktop, mobile or web) to act as DHT nodes.

You can also launch your own dWeb DHT node via the command-line, by using the DHT CLI [here](https://github.com/distributedweb/cli).
